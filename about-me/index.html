            One of the most important things in life is finding what you love to
            do, so you'll never feel like you're working. I've tried many
            different things, and coding has become a part of me. I love coding
            and I'm thrilled to join the bootcamp at TripleTen.

            From hate to love, I have a beautiful story about my running
            experience. Now, I have my own running club, surrounded by amazing
            people, and a wealth of inspiration to keep growing.

            Things I do for my soul. Music brings me immense happiness and has
            always held a special place in my heart. It was my first dream that
            came true. It was like a magic through very tough path, but this
            love will live forever in me.

            No one can ever come back the same person after a trip. One thing
            that will change everyone for the better - is traveling. Traveling
            is about healing, growing, and exploring. It's all about you and who
            you truly are.
